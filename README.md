# diabetes-deep-learning-prediction


This project uses deep learning to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on medical data. The goal is to build, train, and evaluate a neural network model that can assist in early diagnosis and risk assessment.

## 📁 Project Overview
The notebook `diabetics_deep.ipynb` contains the complete workflow, including:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature normalization
- Model creation using deep learning (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch)
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics visualization

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn

# 📊 Dataset

This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which includes health-related attributes such as:

- Glucose level

- Blood pressure

- Insulin level

- BMI

- Age




# 📈 Results

The trained deep learning model achieves strong predictive accuracy and can be fine-tuned using additional hyperparameter optimization techniques such as:

* Dropout layers

* Learning rate scheduling

* Early stopping

# 💡 Future Improvements

.  Integrate a web interface for 

.  Integrate a web interface for real-time predictions

.  Compare deep learning with traditional ML algorithms

.   Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit
